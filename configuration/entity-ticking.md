Stratum throttles server-side entity ticking by distance to the nearest player. The
settings live under `Performance.EntityTicking` in `stratum.json` or the
`stratum-performance.json` sidecar, and the feature is on by default. This page covers
the exact semantics: what anchors the distance bands, what is exempt, and what to
expect when testing against the throttle. All values below are the shipped defaults.

## Distance bands

Each entity ticks every Nth server tick based on the 3D distance to the nearest
anchoring player:

| Band | Distance (blocks) | Interval | Keys |
|---|---|---|---|
| Near | up to 32 | every tick | `NearDistanceBlocks` |
| Mid | up to 64 | every 2nd tick | `MidDistanceBlocks`, `MidTickInterval` |
| Far | up to 96 | every 5th tick | `FarEntityDistanceBlocks`, `FarEntityTickInterval` |
| Very far | beyond | every 10th tick | `VeryFarTickInterval` |

Band edges are clamped so they never invert (near, then mid, then far), and the
intervals so they never decrease with distance.

## What anchors the bands

Distances are measured to players **whose entity has spawned**, meaning clients in the
Playing state. This matters more than it looks:

- A client that is still connecting, authenticating, or downloading assets has no
  entity yet and anchors nothing.
- The measurement is **per dimension**: a player in another dimension does not anchor
  entities in this one.
- With no anchoring player at all (empty server, or none in the entity's dimension),
  every entity ticks at the very-far interval. Entities never stop ticking entirely.

## Exemptions

Checked per entity, in this order:

- **Player entities** are never throttled.
- **`ThrottleCreatures` / `ThrottleInanimate`** (both `true`): turn off throttling for
  a whole entity class.
- **Moving entities** (`SkipMovingEntities`, `true`): an entity whose motion exceeds
  `MovingEntitySpeedThreshold` (0.01 blocks per tick) is not throttled that tick. Note
  that even a dropped item keeps enough residual motion to stay exempt for a long time.
- **Excluded mod domains** (`ExcludedModDomains`, default `["vsvillage"]`): entities
  from these asset domains are never throttled and are also exempt from the creature
  budget below. Custom AI and pathfinder mods can assume a near-constant tick
  frequency, and throttling them can corrupt their internal state (observed with
  VSVillage's pathfinder: villagers froze at town edges under an earlier version of
  this system).

## Ambient fauna tier

On top of the band interval, entities whose code matches `AmbientFaunaCodePrefixes`
(fish, butterflies, bees, hens and similar) get an extra stride multiplier
(`AmbientFaunaTickMultiplier`, default 2): background mood does not need full-rate AI
even near a player. Disable with `AmbientFaunaTierEnabled: false`.

## Creature budget

`MaxCreatureTicksPerTick` (default 0, meaning unlimited) hard-caps creature ticks per
server tick with round-robin fairness. It is opt-in, and it has **no effect in
parallel physics mode** (all creatures tick every frame there; `/stratum health`
warns when this combination is configured).

## Restoring vanilla behavior

`Performance.EntityTicking.Enabled: false` restores exact vanilla ticking: every
loaded entity ticks once per entity-simulation tick, everywhere.

## Testing against the throttle

Hard-won notes for anyone writing scenarios or load tests against this system (this
is how the [StratumParity](https://github.com/Pixnop/StratumParity) differential
suite pins these semantics down):

- **Your test client must reach the Playing state** before it anchors anything. A
  headless client stuck in Connected leaves the server in the no-anchor case above,
  and every entity quietly ticks at the very-far rate.
- **Keep probe entities motionless** or `SkipMovingEntities` will exempt them from
  the very throttle you are measuring. A straw dummy stands perfectly still; a
  dropped item does not.
- **Derive geometry from the player's actual position**, read after any teleport
  settles: joins scatter players around the spawn point, which can silently move a
  probe across a band boundary.
- **Assert exact counts, not rates**: an unthrottled entity ticks exactly once per
  entity-simulation tick, a very-far entity exactly 1 in 10 (up to stride phase at
  the window edges). With the toggle off, both must equal the simulation tick count
  exactly.
- **Same dimension only**: a probe in another dimension measures the no-anchor case,
  not the band you placed a player in.
